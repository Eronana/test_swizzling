# Test Swizzling
Some short code for show swizzling

## How to run
There are two way to run:
1. Just run `make run`.
2. You can run `prog` by `./prog` and use other tool like osxinj to inject `injlib.dylib`.

## prog
A simple program that will be injected `injlib.dylib`.

## injlib.dylib
A dynamic library that will inject to `prog`.

## Others
I started learning Objective-C three days ago, please forgive me if there is anything wrong.
